%p.about Animal Rescue is an Australia-wide not-for-profit organisation inspiring a whole nation to discover the joy and unconditional love a rescue pet brings.

%p.about With the awesome support of our growing community of pet lovers, PetRescue has become Australiaâ€™s most visited charity website. Every day we bring pet seekers face-to-furry-face with thousands of adorable rescue pets from shelters and rescue groups nationwide, empowering Australians to save over 6,000 lives every month. Find out more about us here.

%p.about Dogs rescued from the pound are microchipped, heartworm tested and vaccinated by a veterinarian, who also gives them a basic health check and provides us with an estimate of their age. The dogs are desexed (if required) and given any additional veterinary treatment to return them to good health.

%p.about All of the rescued dogs are then cared for, awaiting adoption into a permanent loving home. Once the dogs have completed 8-10 days quarantine (so we can observe them for any illnesses they may have picked up) they stay at our shelter, Doggiewood at Ingleside in the northern beaches of Sydney or can be placed into a foster home.

%p.about We have over 200 dogs up for adoption. They are all featured on this site. Over a year we save about 500 dogs.

%p.about We ask re-imbursement for the basic desexing, vaccination, microchipping and heartworm testing only - generally between $350 and $500.
